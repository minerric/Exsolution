## Multiple MN on one VPS:

It is possible to run multiple **Sanchezium** Master Nodes on the same VPS. Each MN will run under a different user you will choose during installation.  

***


## Usage:  

For security reasons **Sanchezium** is installed under **sanchezium** user, hence you need to **su - sanchezium** before checking:    

```
SNCZ_USER=sanchezium #replace sanchezium with the MN username you want to check

su - $SNCZ_USER
Sancheziumd masternode status
Sancheziumd getinfo
```  

Also, if you want to check/start/stop **Sancheziumd** , run one of the following commands as **root**:

```
SNCZ_USER=sanchezium  #replace sanchezium with the MN username you want to check  
  
systemctl status $SNCZ_USER #To check the service is running.  
systemctl start $SNCZ_USER #To start SancheziumD service.  
systemctl stop $ASNCZ_USER #To stop SancheziumD service.  
systemctl is-enabled $SNCZ_USER #To check whetether SancheziumD service is enabled on boot or not.  
```
